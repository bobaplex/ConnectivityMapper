## Project Summary  
This project aims to optimize cell tower placement by leveraging machine learning to analyze terrain, connectivity gaps, and ROI. The goal is to identify locations that maximize coverage and user adoption while minimizing infrastructure costs, enabling smarter business decisions for telecom expansion.

---

## Background  
With the increasing demand for seamless connectivity, telecom companies face challenges in expanding coverage efficiently. Traditional methods for tower placement often overlook terrain constraints, user demand patterns, and cost-effectiveness. This project uses geospatial data, signal propagation models, and demographic insights to address these challenges.

---

## Problem Statement  
- **Objective**: Develop an ML model to recommend optimal cell tower locations based on terrain, connectivity, and ROI.  
- **Key Questions**:  
  - Where are the coverage gaps in existing networks?  
  - Which locations will maximize user adoption and ROI?  
  - How can terrain and infrastructure costs be factored into placement decisions?  

---

## Datasets  
1. **Terrain Data**: Elevation and land cover data from [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/).  
2. **Connectivity Data**: Signal strength maps and tower locations from [FCC](https://www.fcc.gov/).  
3. **Demographics**: Population density and income levels from [Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/).  
4. **Infrastructure Costs**: Land prices and construction costs (to be sourced from public datasets or estimates).  

---

## Tools & Packages  
- **Python Libraries**:  
  - `geopandas` (geospatial data processing)  
  - `scikit-learn` (ML modeling)  
  - `rasterio` (terrain data analysis)  
  - `folium` (interactive maps)  
- **Other Tools**:  
  - Jupyter Notebooks for prototyping.  
  - GitHub for version control and collaboration.  

---

## Methodology  
1. **Data Collection**: Gather terrain, connectivity, and demographic datasets.  
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create features like terrain ruggedness, coverage gaps, and population density.  
3. **Model Development**: Train an ML model to predict ROI and user demand for potential tower locations.  
4. **Optimization**: Use the model to recommend optimal tower placements.  
5. **Visualization**: Create interactive maps to showcase results.  

---

## Expected Outcomes  
- A machine learning model that predicts ROI and user demand for cell tower locations.  
- A ranked list of optimal tower placements with associated metrics (e.g., expected users, cost, ROI).  
- Interactive visualizations of coverage improvements and recommended placements.
